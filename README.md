# SimpleWebApi

Building a simple Web API project using the following concepts:

* Command/Query objects with handlers
* Decorators instead of AOP
* Mediator
* ...

All these concepts are based on the blogs & video's on my blog.

My goal is to keep these implementations as simple as possible (without using too much magic).
